# Google-Maps-Scraper
### Automated Bot that scrape businesses data from Google Maps.

Tools: Python, Selenium Chrome Driver, Regex.

### Project 

The task was to automate the Google maps web page to extract data of each and every search result that appeared against a key word search.
Like if we type "Hotels in New York" then it will automate every single step ahead and saves the data in an Excel file.
The task was very tricky as Google Web pages refresh the location of its elements on each click. And the bot was unable to find the elements upfront.

This Bot has every exception handled and it will not be stuck on any page it continuously checks on which page it is and shifts according to the correct page.
The fields it extracts from each business or location are:

Name, Address, Phone, Website,
Star Rating, Top 20 Reviews, Opening Hours,
Image Link, Iframe Code to embed map location.
